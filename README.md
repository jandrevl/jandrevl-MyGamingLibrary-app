# jandrevl-MyGamingLibrary-app
Ironhack BootCamp Final Project

This is going to be a "Games Library" app, called MyGamingLibrary

Users will be able to search games by name, add the game to it's favourites, and leave a comment/experience/opinion about a game.

The user should be allowed to register. It should only be able to add games to a favourite list and comment on a game after registering.

The user should be able to modify it's data once registered.

Admin users can delete, modify or block users, and modify or delete comments left by regular users.

The home page should present the user with 8 cards of random games, each time the page is loaded.
